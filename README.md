Analyzing security report in Japan

## Motivation
I wanted an answer whether GDP per captia in Japan is reasonable or not.  
Security report provided by [EDINET](https://disclosure2.edinet-fsa.go.jp/WEEK0010.aspx)  was a perfect
start to answer to my question since it includes information about the labor cost.
